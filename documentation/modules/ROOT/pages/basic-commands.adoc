While there are plenty of commands available in Linux, there are a certain few that are crucial to your Linux experience.
Most likely, you'll end up using these commands daily.

[#whoami]
== Using `whoami`

The `whoami` command prints the user name of the currently logged-in user. Running the below command would result in the output of the username associated with current effective user id.

In addition, the `who` command is used to provide more system information, including when the system has booted last time, a list of logged-in users, and the systemâ€™s current run level.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
sudo reboot

[#which]
== Using which

The 'which' command is used to locate the executable file associated with a given command. It prints the full path of the executable command file that is executed when a user runs a particular command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]

which ls

[.console-output]
[source,bash]

/bin/ls

In the above example, the output '/bin/ls' shows that the 'ls' command is located in the '/bin' directory.
