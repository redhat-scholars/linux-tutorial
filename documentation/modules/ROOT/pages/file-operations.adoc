= File operations
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Starting out in Linux, you'll spend a great deal of time interacting with files and directories (folders). 
Here, you'll learn basic file operations that can help you work in your Linux enviroment.

[#mkdir]
== Using `mkdir`

The `mkdir` command is used to make new directories in Linux. It creates a directory in the current working directory, unless some other path is specified.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
mkdir Downloads
----


[#ls]
== Using `ls`

To list files on a Linux system, you can use the command `ls`. 
It's one of the most commonly used and useful file operation commands. 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ls
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Downloads
----

While a standard `ls` command will list files in your current directory, you can use it to list files in any directory within your machine by specifying the directory.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ls Downloads
----

[#cp]
== Using `cp`

The `cp` command stands for copy, and will copy a file to another name or another location.
Let's use this command in addition with `touch`, which is the easiest way to create a new file in Linux.
Firstly, let's create a new file called `file1.txt`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
touch file1.txt
----

Now, let's copy this file into the newly created `Downloads` folder.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
cp file1.txt Downloads/file2.txt
ls Downloads
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
file2.txt
----

[#mv]
== Using `mv`

The "mv" command is used to move a file to another destination or rename the file to a new name.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
mv Downloads/file2.txt ~
ls
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Downloads  file1.txt  file2.txt
----

[#cat]
== Using `cat`

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file. Before using this command, let's add some text to the file we created earlier using `echo` and use `>` to redirect the output to the file.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
echo "This is some text" > file1.txt
cat file1.txt
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
This is some text
----

[#rm]
== Using `rm`

The `rm` command is used to remove files and directories. Let's remove the file we created earlier.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
rm file1.txt
----
