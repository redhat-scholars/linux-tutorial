**Linux** is an **open source operating system** (OS). 

An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. 

The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

== How does Linux work?

Linux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but has evolved to run on a wide variety of hardware from phones to supercomputers.

Every Linux-based OS involves the **Linux kernel**—which manages hardware resources—and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system.

The OS includes some common core components, like the **GNU tools**, among others.
