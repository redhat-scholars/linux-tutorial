= Installing unpackaged software
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In some cases, you'll need to install an application from it's source code.
Let's take a look at how to compile and install new software using RHEL.

[#downloading-source]
== Downloading the source code

While there are plenty of applications we could install, let's take https://www.vim.org/[Vim] for example. 
Vim is a popular text editor used in most Linux systems, and is simple to use. 
First, let's go to the https://github.com/vim/vim/tags[release page] for Vim, and download the most recent `tar.gz`, which contains the software in a compressed tar format.

Right click and copy the link address for this specific release so we can then download it in our RHEL machine.
Next, let's use `curl` to download this specific `tar.gz` link to our local machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl -OL https://github.com/vim/vim/archive/refs/tags/v9.0.0652.tar.gz
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

----

After a few seconds, we'll see that the file has been downloaded in our current directory.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ls
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Downloads  file1.txt  file2.txt  v9.0.0652.tar.gz
----

[#unpacking-file]
== Extracting the archive

To extract the source code from the package, we can use the `tar` command with a few arguments like so.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
tar xvf v9.0.0652.tar.gz
----

After everything has been extracted, you'll now have a new file in your local directory, named `v9.0.0652` or the respective name of the downloaded `tar` file.
Let's do a quick `cd` command to change directories into this new folder, and list the items in our directory.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
cd vim-9.0.0652
ls
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
ci               Filelist  nsis       README.md       runtime  uninstall.txt
configure        LICENSE   pixmaps    README.txt      src      vimtutor.bat
CONTRIBUTING.md  Makefile  READMEdir  README_VIM9.md  tools    vimtutor.com

[#installing-souce]
== Installing the source code

Now that we're in the newly extracted folder, we can install the unpackaged software.
Firstly, however, we need to install the development tools, which include gcc, our C compiler, and more.
This can be done by using `dnf` as we have done before, with the following command. You'll also need a terminal library, for this we can use `ncurses`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" && dnf install ncurses-devel

Complete!

Now, we can run the `configure` script in the folder, using the following command. This will analyze the system, and produce a Makefile that contains the logic to build and install the package.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
./configure
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
configure: loading cache auto/config.cache
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
...
config.status: creating auto/config.h
----

Now, we can compile the source code to generate the binaries using the `make` command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
make
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Starting make in the src directory.
...
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/ec2-user/vim-9.0.0652/src'
----

Almost there! After `make` completes, the binary files are ready to install.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
make install
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Starting make in the src directory.
...
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/ec2-user/vim-9.0.0652/src'
----

Congratulations! `vim` should now be installed properly on your system, and you can double check the installation with the following command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
vim --version
