Cockpit is a simple-to-use, lightweight, web-based interface for Linux servers. 
You can manage storage, networking, firewall, containers, and much more right from your web browser, instead of needing to use the command line.
Let's look into how to install Cockpit, as well as some basic functionality.

From here, you can use your RHEL credentials that you made during setup to access the Cockpit interface.

[#using-cockpit-metrics]
== Using cockpit: Metrics

Let's firstly use Cockpit to get a real-time update on our machine's performance metrics.
From the Overview dashboard, select the *View details and history* to visit the metrics page.

[#using-cockpit-accounts]
== Using cockpit: Accounts

We can use Cockpit to create new accounts, and modify our existing ones.
From the Overview dashboard, select the *Accounts* tab.

The Accounts dashboard allows us to work with our machine's accounts. Let's select our current user for example.

Cockpit provides an easy GUI to give our user administrative permission, logs of login history, changing the password, and even modifying authorized SSH keys.

[#using-cockpit-terminal]
== Using cockpit: Terminal

A simple feature of Cockpit is that it provides a standard shell in a terminal, which allows for the same privileges as if you had logged in through SSH.
From the Overview dashboard, select the *Terminal* tab.

Here, we can do anything we could do over SSH, but instead in our web browser.
