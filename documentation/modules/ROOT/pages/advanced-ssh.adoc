SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol which facilitates secure communications between two systems using a client-server architecture and allows users to log in to server host systems remotely.

[#using-ssh-keygen]
== Using ssh-keygen

`ssh-keygen` is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. Such key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.
There's no need to use arguments for this tool, as it will prompt for for a file to store keys, and associated passphrase.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa): ssh-key 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ssh-key.
Your public key has been saved in ssh-key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:sS8LTj0bVA+ECZqbrEvHuiAYIQuuqcbjT6vCjSusp48 ec2-user@ip-172-31-17-21.us-east-2.compute.internal
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|      .. o.      |
|     o  o.       |
|+   o   . o      |

|EBX+  . o        |

Congrats! You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate. Now, let's place the public key on your server so you can use SSH-key-based authentication to sign on.

[#using-ssh-copy-id]
== Using ssh-copy-id

The `ssh-copy-id` command allows you to add a public key to a remote machine's authorized_keys file. The command goes as follows.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ssh-copy-id username@remote_host_ip
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
The authenticity of host 'remote_host_ip' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is f1:d7:e8:f2:44:fe:34:71:e6:11:98:da:d9:3e:51:ff.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Now, after typing in your password, the tool will copy the contents of your SSH key into the remote account's authorized key folder, and you can use `ssh` normally to login.

[#using-scp]
== Using scp

Similarly, you can use the secure copy command (`scp`), in conjunction with ssh key authentication, for an even more secure means of copying files to your remote Linux servers.
Use the format of the following command to send a file to your remote server using your ssh key.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub filename username@remote_host_ip:/home/username/filename
----

[#ssh-config]
== SSH configuration

SSH clients can be configured using a global or local configuration file to save time and typing frequently used ssh client command-line options such as port, user, hostname, and more.
This is found in the `.ssh/config` file on a system, and more information can be found https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config[here].
