= Terminal multiplexer: tmux
include::_attributes.adoc[]

https://github.com/tmux/tmux[Tmux] is an open source application that adds layers (or "windows," in tmux terminology) to your terminal window so that you can open more than one terminal in a single desktop window.

[#installing-tmux]
== Installing tmux

To get started with the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, we simply need to install `tmux` using `dnf`.

[#starting-with-tmux]
== Getting started with tmux

Here, we can now start our first `tmux` session by simply typing `tmux` in the terminal. You'll notice everything stays the same, except for the green line at the bottom of our terminal, indicating we're connected to a `tmux` server as a client.

Now, we can begin to utilize the pane management capabilities of `tmux` but using shortcuts:

* Horizontal split: `Ctrl-b "`
* Vertical split: `Ctrl-b %`

You'll need to first do `Ctrl-b`, letting `tmux` know you're about to give it a command, then the key for vertical/horizontal afterwards. For example, if you do a horizontal split and a vertical split, your terminal window should look like so.

You can now use the `Ctrl-b` with any arrow of your choice to move around the various windows. Pretty neat!

[#tmux-window-management]
== Window Management with tmux

Perhaps you'd like multiple windows to split into panes and run commands, much like a traditional web browser. 
`tmux` provides support to do so using the `Ctrl-b c` feature to create new windows.

From here, you can have multiple windows, each with different commands and packages running. 
To switch around windows, simply use the `Ctrl-b` shortcut, then select which window you'd like to switch to from the green menu bar at the bottom of the terminal (ex. `Ctrl-b 2` for Vim).
